# SquMES (Squantor Modular Electronics System)
This repository contains a modular system for electronics projects. 
This system comprises of a backplane and some modules, the modules are inserted into the backplane. Instead of the [ModEleSys](https://github.com/Squantor/ModEleSys) where everything is horizontal, the SquMES is vertical, this makes the backplane not so big and a bit more space efficient but the modules also have more PCB surface allowing more complex projects.

WARNING: This is still a work in progress, check back later if you are interested.

## Structure
* [electronics](electronics/README.md) contains electronics schematics and PCB drawings using Kicad
* [mechanical](mechanical/README.md) contains all the CAD drawings, mostly 3d printable objects.
* [documentation](documentation/README.md) contains more in depth information and examples using this system.
## Cloning
This repository makes use of submodules, use ```git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Squantor/generic_project_template.git``` to clone everything in one go.
